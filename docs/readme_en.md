## Introduce

### Introduction

**AQ** is an `interpreted` **programming language**. It's `fast`, `small`, `simple` and `safe`. At the same time, programs written in AQ can also be compiled. *Perhaps a great work. *

[![AQ Card](https://aq-org-github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=aq-org&repo=AQ)](https://github.com/aq-org/AQ)

### Features

- **Fast** (`source code` compilation and `running speed`)
- **Small** (`source code` size)
- **Simple** (easy to learn)
- **Security** (safe `memory management` and `code inspection`)
- **Cross-platform** (supports `Windows`, `Linux` and `MacOS`, etc.)
- Similar to `C++` syntax (quick mastery)
- Interpreted (optional `compilation`)
- Free (subject to `AQL License`)
- Open source (under `AQL license`)
### The following is a comparison between the **AQ** language and 15 other mainstream programming languages in different aspects:

| Language | Types | Speed | Size | Simplicity | Security | Cross-platform | Syntax style | Execution | Open source | Application areas |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | -------- | -------- | --------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------- | ----------- |
| AQ | Interpreted/Compiled | ★★★★ | ★★★★★ | ★★★★★ | ★★★★★ | ★★★★★ | Object-oriented/Procedural | Interpreted/Compiled | √ | General |
| C | Compiled | ★★★★★ | ★★★★ | ★★ | ★★★ | ★★★★ | Procedural | Compiled | √ | System/Underlying |
| C++ | Compiled | ★★★★★ | ★★★★ | ★★★ | ★★★ | ★★★★ | Object-oriented | Compiled | √ | Universal |
| Java | Interpreted/Compiled | ★★★★ | ★★★ | ★★★★ | ★★★★★ | ★★★★★ | Object-oriented | Interpreted/Compiled | √ | Universal |
| Python | Interpreted | ★★★ | ★★★★★ | ★★★★★ | ★★★★ | ★★★★★ | Object-oriented | Interpreted | √ | Universal |
| JavaScript | Interpreted | ★★★★ | ★★★★★ | ★★★★ | ★★★ | ★★★★★ | Object-oriented | Interpreted | √ | Web/Server |
| Go | Compiled | ★★★★★ | ★★★★ | ★★★★ | ★★★★ | ★★★★★ | Procedural | Compiled | √ | System/Network |
| Ruby | Interpreted | ★★★ | ★★★★ | ★★★★★ | ★★★★ | ★★★★★ | Object-oriented | Interpreted | √ | Web Development |
| Swift | Compiled | ★★★★★ | ★★★★ | ★★★★ | ★★★★★ | ★★★ | Object-oriented | Compiled | √ | Mobile development |
| Rust | Compiled | ★★★★★ | ★★★★★ | ★★★ | ★★★★★ | ★★★★★ | Object-oriented | Compiled | √ | System/Web |
| Kotlin | Compiled | ★★★★ | ★★★★ | ★★★★ | ★★★★★ | ★★★★★ | Object-oriented | Compiled | √ | Mobile/Server |
| Scala | Compiled | ★★★★ | ★★★ | ★★★ | ★★★★ | ★★★★★ | Functional | Compiled | √ | Big Data/Web |
| R | Interpretation | ★★ | ★★★★★ | ★★★★ | ★★★★ | ★★★★ | Matrix | Interpretation | √ | Statistics/Data Analysis |
| Perl | Interpreted | ★★★ | ★★★★ | ★★★ | ★★★ | ★★★★★ | Procedural | Interpreted | √ | Text Processing/Web |
| PHP | Interpreted | ★★★ | ★★★★★ | ★★★★★ | ★★★ | ★★★★★ | Object-oriented | Interpreted | √ | Web Development |

Notice:
1. The number of stars represents the degree of excellence in this aspect (maximum 5 stars).
2. This is only a rough comparison, and the actual situation may be different.
3. The open source mark (√) indicates that the language itself is open source.

As can be seen from the table, the **AQ** language has better performance in terms of speed, size, simplicity, security and cross-platformness. Its syntax style is similar to `C++`, it can be interpreted and executed or compiled and executed, and it is completely open source. AQ aims to be a general-purpose programming language suitable for various application scenarios. Compared with other languages, its advantage is that it has both high performance and ease of use.

### Development progress

**AQ** is currently under active development and has implemented basic `syntax` and `functions`. But there is still a lot of work to be done, including optimizing performance, adding library support and improving development tools. We welcome everyone to join the development and contribute to **AQ**!

## Quick Start
### Install

**AQ** can be installed in `multiple ways`, including `source code compilation` and `precompiled binaries`. The specific installation steps vary by platform, please check the [Installation Guide](docs/installation.md) for more information.

On platforms such as `Linux`, you can compile like this:
```shell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

On `Windows`, you need to download `CMake` and other necessary tools first, and then `compile`.

Finally, you can run on `Linux` and `Windows`:
```shell
cd aq

# Find an executable file like aq or aq.exe and run it
```

### Usage
You can run **AQ** using the `command line` or the `GUI`.
```shell
./aq <file> -other-options
```

Please see [documentation](#document) for details

## Contributors

AQ is an open source project and everyone is welcome to contribute to it! Whether it's filing a bug report, participating in code development, improving documentation, or providing suggestions, any kind of contribution is highly appreciated.

## License

**AQ** is based on [AQL License](https://github.com/aq-org/AQ/blob/main/LICENSE). This is a `license` designed specifically for **AQ** to protect **AQ**'s `intellectual property` and `community interests`.

The `AQL License` allows you to `freely use`, `modify` and `distribute` **AQ** under the conditions of the license, but it also has some restrictions on your actions. For example, you need to retain **AQ**'s `copyright statement` and `license text` and not use them for illegal or unethical purposes.

If you plan to use **AQ** for `commercial use`, or develop `derivative products` based on **AQ**, please read the full text of the `AQL License` carefully and abide by the `terms and conditions` therein. If you have any questions, you can also contact us at any time.

In addition, **AQ** itself may also use "parts of code" from other "open source software", and these codes may be subject to "other licenses". We will accurately mark these `license information` in the code.

We believe that the `AQL License` can well balance **AQ**'s `open source` and `intellectual property protection`, creating favorable conditions for **AQ**'s `long-term development`. If you have any questions or suggestions about the license, please feel free to discuss it with us.
