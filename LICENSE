Version 1, January 27, 2024

Definition
"This License" means version 1 of the AQ License.
"AQ Author" refers to the first author of AQ (the creator of AQ).
"Program" or "Work" means any legally protected work licensed under this License.
"Copyright" applies to all types of works for which copyright is recognized by law.
"You" and "your" refer to (a) the company or organization receiving the license (the "Entity") on whose behalf the license is accepted; (b) the individual receiving the license (the "individual") who does not accept the license on behalf of the Entity.
To "modify" a work means to copy or adapt all or part of the work in a manner that requires copyright permission, rather than making an exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of an earlier work or a work "based on" an earlier work.
A "covered work" means an unmodified copy of the Program or a work based on the Program (including any work based on covered work or any work based on a "modified version" of an earlier work).
"Propagating" a work means doing anything to the work without permission that would subject you directly or secondarily to liability for infringement under applicable copyright law, other than executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes reproduction, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and other activities in certain countries.
"Development Use" means your internal use of the Program to develop, test, prototype and demonstrate your Application.
"Personal Use" means an individual's use of the Program solely on a desktop or laptop computer under his/her control solely for the purpose of running personal applications.

If your License is suspended or expires, you shall delete the Program, "modified versions" of the earlier work, and all of its "covered works." and cease all activities related to the Program, "modified versions" of earlier works, and "covered works".
